        <p>Hello, my name is Justine! I am a junior full-stack developer & knowledge enthusiast. I live in London and enjoy watching films, listening to and discovering new music, and travelling.
          <br />
          <br />
        I first got into coding in 2015 when I discovered an app called Episode which allows you to create a visual and interactive version of your story through code. This allowed me to marry two of my favourite hobbies: writing and creating. This was when I truly felt that I am a multipotentialite. As Frederickson et al. described, this is someone who <i>&quot;when provided with appropriate environments, can select and develop a number of competencies to a high level&quot;</i>. I truly feel that being a developer is one of these competencies.
          <br />
          <br />
        I love learning and progressing in places that I am passionate about. Enrolling on the Software Engineering course at GA was where I truly felt that I could pursue this.
          <br />
          <br />
        Outside of being a developer, I love writing and have been doing it since I was young. I have been working on a coming-of-age novel since 2016. I am currently writing/coding an original fantasy story with 12 published chapters and over 9000 reads. You can check it out <a href="http://episodeinteractive.com/s/6014349999407104" className="episode">here</a> on your phone!

          <br />
        I also love playing video games. I am a master at Tetris. My favourite games to play are Overwatch, Valheim, Minecraft, and my favourite RPG&apos;s are Skyrim and Witcher 3.
